# Reservoir Computing for Macroeconomic Forecasting with Mixed Frequency Data

Repository for the UKRI funded project **Reservoir Computing for Macroeconomic Modelling**, Ref: ES/V006347/1.

Project structure:

* `python`: model code; MIDAS and multi-frequency ESN model libraries; DFM model scripts; Jupyter notebooks with estimation, forecasting and simulations.

* `R`: data clearning; model forecast restructuring and statistical tests (MCS etc).

* `figures`: all exported figures used in the paper.

Wherever possible, raw data is also included in the `data` folder. For details regarding data copyrights and sources, please refer to `data/info.txt`.
